# Solar-System-Demo
A Simulation of the entire Solar System. This Program shows how it would look if you were to gaze at the Solar System from the space itself. The REVOLUTION TIME of the planets has been adjusted so that the user does not have to wait for centuries to look at a complete revolution cycle. The Distance between each of the planets have been taken from react and verified data (Of Course they are also scaled according to the screen size of your Monitor)
